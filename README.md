# -Image-Encryption-Tool-
ðŸ”’ Problem Statement
Develop a simple image encryption tool using pixel manipulation. The program should allow users to encrypt and decrypt images by modifying pixel values through operations like swapping pixel values or applying basic mathematical transformations to each pixel.

âœ¨ Features
âœ… Encrypts images by altering pixel values.
âœ… Decrypts images back to their original form.
âœ… Uses pixel swapping and mathematical operations for encryption.
âœ… Ensures image security through pixel-level transformations.
